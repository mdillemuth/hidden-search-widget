## Demo

## Description

A clever and simple interactive search bar component. When the user clicks the search-menu icon, the search bar is rendered on the screen with a small animation.

The JS is used to handle listening for the click event on the icon and toggling an active class and focusing the users mouse to the search input. CSS handles the animation and everything else.

## Technology

- HTML
  - Semantic HTML5
  - Accessibilty compliant
- CSS
  - Animation
- JavaScript
  - ES6 Syntax

## Modifications from the Original

- Improved accessibility by adding _aria-label_ to the search-icon button
